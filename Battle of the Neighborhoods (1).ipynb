    "A client is looking to open an Italian Restaurant in the Sydney region. Given the cost of operating a restuarant and leasing a building in Sydney, he does not know which region in Sydney to look towards. With this problem, I'll be comparing the Central & Inner Metropolitan, North Shore and Northern Beaches of Sydney (which are far more costly) against the Western Suburbs, Parramatta-Hills District, South Western Suburbs, Outer Western Suburbs and Macarthur Region (which are cheaper but quite a fair distance away from Sydney).
